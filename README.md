# Dungeons and Dragon 5e Random Character Generator, in python

This is written in Python 2.7, with intent to be packaged in a container image.

Parts of this were done "the hard way" as a learning exercise.

It will generate a random 1st level character with:
* Random race, class, and alignment
* Stats rolled with "4d6 drop the lowest"  
* Stats placed appropriately for the chosen class

TBD:
* Combat stats
* Equipment, at all
* Magic, at all
